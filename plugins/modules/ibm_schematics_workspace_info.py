    successfully connected, the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input
    parameters, is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of the workspace
    changes to C(Scanning).
      B(Draft): The workspace is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab
    repository.
      B(Failed): If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure code in IBM
    Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to C(Failed).
      B(Inactive): The Terraform template was scanned successfully and the workspace
    creation is complete. You can now start running Schematics plan and apply jobs to
    provision the IBM Cloud resources that you specified in your template. If you have an
    C(Active) workspace and decide to remove all your resources, your workspace is set to
    C(Inactive) after all your resources are removed.
      B(In progress): When you instruct IBM Cloud Schematics to run your infrastructure
    code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes to
    C(In progress).
      B(Scanning): The download of the Terraform template is complete and vulnerability
    scanning started. If the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to
    C(Inactive). If errors in your template are found, the state changes to C(Template
    Error).
      B(Stopped): The Schematics plan, apply, or destroy job was cancelled manually.
      B(Template Error): The Schematics template contains errors and cannot be processed."
